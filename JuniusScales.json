  {"id":"Scales2005","abstract":"On November 18, 1954, Junius Irving Scales, the Communist Party district organizer for the upper South, was arrested on a quiet Memphis street by FBI agents. Charged with violation of the Smith Act of 1940, Scales spent the next six years ensnared in a legal system that was in thrall to a daunting force: McCarthyism. Scales’s case twice reached the U.S. Supreme Court; ultimately, his lower-court guilty verdict was upheld. Scales served fifteen months in Lewisburg Penitentiary before his six-year sentence was commuted by President Kennedy in 1962.\n\nCause at Heart follows Scales from his privileged southern upbringing through the awakening of his social conscience, his civil- and labor- rights work for the Party across the South, his arrest and trials, his disillusionment with the Party, and his time in prison. Even behind bars Scales refused to cooperate with his prosecutors, to “name names.” In their foreword, Vernon Burton and James Barrett draw chilling parallels between the Smith Act, the legal grounds on which Scales was convicted, and contemporary restrictions on individual rights such as the Patriot Act. Today, as it did sixty-plus years ago, “Congress has radically expanded the description of what constitutes a threat to the U.S. government.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Scales","given":"Junius Irving"},{"family":"Nickson","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"Scales2005","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en-US","publisher":"University of Georgia Press","title":"Cause at Heart: A Former Communist Remembers","type":"book","URL":"https://www.ugapress.org/9780820327853/cause-at-heart/"},

  {"id":"Taylor2009","abstract":"This book presents a reevaluation of the objectives and actions of Tar Heel 'Reds' from the 1920s to the 1960s. Based on oral histories, archival sources, and previously unpublished documents of the Communist International, \"\"The History of the North Carolina Communist Party\"\" is the first comprehensive narrative account of the Tar Heel State's Communist Party during its half century of existence. Gregory S. Taylor's chronicle of the Party's sustained efforts in North Carolina draws extensively from Comintern files that, after decades of secrecy, have only recently been made available for historical examination. Although others have studied isolated moments of Communist activity within the state, Taylor ties those moments together, linking them with previously unexamined Communist efforts and demonstrating remarkable continuity of activity in North Carolina. As Taylor notes, the North Carolina Communist Party was a vibrant, socially conscious activist group as well as a political party, and the first organization of its kind in a Southern state. In the 1920s North Carolina saw prolonged and violent struggles between the owners and hired protectors of industrial enterprises and the laborers who worked the mills and factories. From 1929 to 1956 the Party took a leading role to implement change: it unionized tobacco and textile industries, pushed for legislation to benefit the unemployed, demanded civil rights for the disenfranchised, called for peaceful foreign policy, sought judicial and prison reforms, and opposed segregation and what the Party considered 'creeping fascism'. In recounting Party activities from this era, Taylor shows that the main objective was to organize and aid the economically, politically, and culturally downtrodden through social reform rather than through Communist revolution. He reveals Party members to be conscientious North Carolinians, and by extension he challenges long-held assumptions about the Communist presence throughout the United States. Although decimated in the 1960s by internal dissension, FBI infiltration, and cold-war politics, the North Carolina Communist Party left a reform-minded legacy that continues to influence the state. Taylor's study shows that North Carolina Communists were not dangerous threats to national security as they were often depicted. They were not beholden to the Soviet Union, nor did they try to overthrow the democratic process. In hindsight it becomes clear that their goals were not inherently anti-American, considering that much of what they advocated - such as civil rights, unionization, and unemployment insurance - has since become part of the national consensus.","author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Gregory S."}],"citation-key":"Taylor2009","ISBN":"978-1-57003-802-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"280","publisher":"Univ of South Carolina Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The History of the North Carolina Communist Party","type":"book"},
