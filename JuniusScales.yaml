    On November 18, 1954, Junius Irving Scales, the Communist Party district
    organizer for the upper South, was arrested on a quiet Memphis street by FBI
    agents. Charged with violation of the Smith Act of 1940, Scales spent the
    next six years ensnared in a legal system that was in thrall to a daunting
    force: McCarthyism. Scales’s case twice reached the U.S. Supreme Court;
    ultimately, his lower-court guilty verdict was upheld. Scales served fifteen
    months in Lewisburg Penitentiary before his six-year sentence was commuted
    by President Kennedy in 1962.


    Cause at Heart follows Scales from his privileged southern upbringing
    through the awakening of his social conscience, his civil- and labor- rights
    work for the Party across the South, his arrest and trials, his
    disillusionment with the Party, and his time in prison. Even behind bars
    Scales refused to cooperate with his prosecutors, to “name names.” In their
    foreword, Vernon Burton and James Barrett draw chilling parallels between
    the Smith Act, the legal grounds on which Scales was convicted, and
    contemporary restrictions on individual rights such as the Patriot Act.
    Today, as it did sixty-plus years ago, “Congress has radically expanded the
    description of what constitutes a threat to the U.S. government.”

    "There was tremendous resentment from generations from mistreatment. Most of
    the black women leaders, at least up until the time of the union, had never
    had an encounter with a white person that wasn't painful, humiliating or
    worse. So trying to get this across to white guys who were from the North, a
    lot of them, from outside the area, it was one hell of a thing."

    - Junius Scales

    Born in Greensboro in 1920, Scales moved with his family to Chapel Hill in
    1936 where he completed his senior year…

    One of the few publicly known communists in the South, Junius Scales
    organized textile workers, fought segregation, and was the only American to
    be imprisoned under the membership clause of the Smith Act during the
    McCarthy years. This compact collective memoir, built on three
    interconnected oral histories and including a historical essay by Gail
    O'Brien, covers Scales's organizing activities and work against racism in
    the South, his progressive disillusionment with Party bureaucracy and
    dogmatic rigidity, his persecution and imprisonment, as well as his family's
    radicalism and response to FBI hounding and blacklisting.Through the
    distinct perspectives of Junius, his wife Gladys, and his daughter Barbara,
    this book deepens and personalizes the story of American radicalism.
    Conversational, intimate, and exceptionally accessible, A Red Family offers
    a unique look at the American communist experience from the inside out.
